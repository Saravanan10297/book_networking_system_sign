# Book Networking system 

This is a CRUD book management application built using Laravel, Filament, and Filament-Excel.

## Getting Started
To get started with the application, you need to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
   
    ```bash
    https://github.com/Saravanan10297/book_networking_system_sign.git
    ```
    Database export file to import on local sql 
    ```bash
      book_networking_system_sign/test/DNS.sql
    ```
    

2. Start the development server.

    php artisan serve
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000/index` in your browser.
  
**Note:** This project is my first-time result of learning Laravel and Filament, 
and it may be subject to further improvements. Feel free to import the provided `perpustakaan.sql` file into your local database and play around with it.
